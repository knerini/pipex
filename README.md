# pipex

Pipex is a project learning how to reproduce the pipe ("|") behaviour. I've to :  
- dealt with `execve` to execute another programm
- learned what are Unix processes and how to handle them with `fork`, `waitpid`
- learned how to redirect stdin/stdout with `pipe`, `dup2`. 

Here the doc I've used to help me understand and do this project :
- [Unix processes](https://code-vault.net/course/46qpfr4tkz:1603732431896)
